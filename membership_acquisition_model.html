        This project used an imbalanced classification model to predict which museum visitors were most likely to respond 
        to a targeted membership campaign. The model was trained on historical engagement, visitation patterns, 
        ticketing behavior, and proximity to the museum. Feature importance and calibration were used to improve model 
        interpretability and lift-based targeting.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final model outperformed random mailing by a significant margin and has been proposed for integration into 
        the museum’s marketing workflow.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Brooklyn Museum is one year into its customer relationship management (CRM) journey with Tessitura,
        a platform that has begun to centralize and enrich its understanding of visitor engagement.
        As the institution builds a more unified data infrastructure, 
        it has also expressed a strategic interest in improving the efficiency of its membership acquisition 
        efforts—particularly in converting ticket buyers and event attendees into long-term members. 
        This model was developed to support that goal: using behavioral, geographic, 
        and transactional data, it aims to identify high-potential prospects and provide a data-informed 
        foundation for targeted outreach campaigns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Special thanks to Alice Northover, Chris Voss, and Alex Valenzuela for their generous support throughout this project.
        Their guidance in navigating Tessitura, explaining the museum’s business rules, and patiently walking me through the
        complexities of membership strategy and institutional context was invaluable to the model’s development and to
        my own growth during the fellowship.
